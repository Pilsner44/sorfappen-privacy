  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> December 1, 2025</p>

  <p>This app ("Sörf Appen"), developed by <strong>JG Tech</strong> (Johan Gummesson), respects your privacy. 
  We do not collect, store, or share personal information beyond what is required for the app’s functionality.</p>

  <h2>Permissions</h2>
  <p>The app uses the following permissions:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Camera:</strong> used to take photos in connection with issue reports.</li>
    <li><strong>Notifications:</strong> used to send information and updates related to issue reports and orders. 
        Notifications only contain relevant information about the case and no sensitive personal data.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Data Handling</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Photos taken through the app are sent together with the issue report and stored in Firebase Storage.</li>
    <li>Photos remain as long as the issue report is active and are deleted once the case is resolved.</li>
    <li>In addition to photos, certain information is stored in Firebase Firestore, such as:
      <ul>
        <li>Employee number (to link the issue report to the correct user).</li>
        <li>Phone numbers not linked to individual persons.</li>
        <li>Description text and details from the issue report.</li>
        <li>Information about products and orders related to the case.</li>
        <li>Information about vehicles and dates for service and inspection of these.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>No sensitive personal information such as national ID numbers is stored.</li>
    <li>Data is not shared with third parties beyond Firebase, which is used for storage and management.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>The app uses Firebase services (Firestore and Storage) from Google to store and manage data related to issue reports. 
  Firebase may process data according to its own terms and privacy policy.</p>

  <h2>Changes</h2>
  <p>If this policy is changed, the updated version will be published on this page.</p>
